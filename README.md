# Students Performance Analysis

This repository contains the **Students Performance Analysis** project, which focuses on analyzing and visualizing students' academic performance. The project uses modern tools to uncover insights and patterns that can aid in improving educational outcomes.

## Features
- ðŸ“Š **Data Visualization:** Detailed charts and graphs for performance insights.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Statistical Analysis:** Identifies trends and correlations in the data.
- ðŸ§  **Machine Learning Models:** Predict student performance based on various factors.
- ðŸ“‹ **Customizable Analysis:** Easily adapt the analysis for different datasets.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NASO7Y/Students-Performance-Analysis.git
   cd Students-Performance-Analysis
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format. Ensure it includes columns like `Gender`, `Test Scores`, `Study Hours`, etc.
2. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. View results and visualizations in the output directory.
